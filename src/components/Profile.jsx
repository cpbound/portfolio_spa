        Here's the autobiographical section. Great stuff! Hailing from the
        bottom bit of the U.K. and now firmly ensconced in Tokyo, Japan; Chris
        (in a time prior to the time you're currently reading this sentence now)
        studied English Literature and Film Studies.
        <br />
        <br />
        After moving to Japan with his wife in 2011, Chris taught English at various
        international schools in Tokyo before (in the heady days of 2020) he
        felt a yearning for something beyond the teaching life. He packed in his
        last teaching gig in early 2022 and completed the full stack web
        development course at Le Wagon.
        <br />
        <br />
        He now divides his time between studying
        as much about web development as he can, making music, looking after his
        family, playing video games and sometimes sleeping when the need arises.
