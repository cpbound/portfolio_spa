        Hullo, Chris here!
        <br />
        <br />
        Originally from the UK, I have been living and working in Japan for over
        10 years now.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since 2022 I've been working as a web developer, creating websites and
        web applications. I've worked with a variety of technologies, including
        React, Ruby, JS, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
        <br />
        <br />I have always had a passion for writing, creating music, film and
        video games and now I'm applying that creative drive to the digital
        space.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why does my does my portfolio look like this? Because Sega Master System
        box art is awesome, that's why. If you really don't believe me, then let
        this chap convince you:
