        🛠️🚧This'll be the profile bit one day. At the moment I'm using it as a
        notes section. Pretty swell. Master Systems boxes are great, huh? Check
        out their beauty here:{" "}

        🛠️🚧The basic layout is okay. It isn't responsive yet but I'll get to
        that. And it doesn't want to play nice with firefox yet but, again,
        we'll get to that.

        🛠️🚧It's already June. Making this thing took way longer than I thought
        but there you go. Trying to fit it in around part time jobs sucked but
        was fun as hell when I got the chance to work on it. Desktop is done,
        mobile is almost there. And I still think Master System boxes are great.
