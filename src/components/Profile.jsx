        🛠️🚧This'll be the profile bit one day. At the moment I'm using it as a
        notes section. Pretty swell. Master Systems boxes are great, huh? Check
        out their beauty here:{" "}

        🛠️🚧The basic layout is okay. It isn't responsive yet but I'll get to
        that. And it doesn't want to play nice with firefox yet but, again,
        we'll get to that.

        🛠️🚧 Anyways, just plain white is a little dull so I might add a little
        plastic or paper texture to the background to make it easier on the eyes
        and look more like an actual used Master System game box. And a
        different picture of me too, even if I love that art.

        🛠️🚧It's May 4th 2023 and I don't care about Star Wars. Added the tool
        tip to the socials bit below. Better than nothing but I want make it
        look a little less harsh later. Next up is putting some pop outs or
        modals for the projects scrollbox on the left and something to point out
        to users that the images are scrollable and clickable.
